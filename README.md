Absolutely! Here's a **story-style project summary report** — the kind you’d present to a hiring manager, interviewer, or business leader to explain **what you did, why you did it, and the impact it delivers**.

## 📘 **Pedal Insights: Data-Driven Sales Strategy**

### 🏁 **The Challenge**

The business team at a cycling products company needed clear visibility into their sales performance, customer behavior, and product demand across global markets. Raw data existed in disconnected tables: **customers**, **products**, and **sales** — but insights were buried and unusable for decision-making.

---

### 💡 **My Approach**

To solve this, I led a data analysis project using **SQL for data wrangling** and **Power BI for visualization**. My objective was to transform the raw data into **business-ready insights** and create a dashboard that tells the story of performance over time, customer segmentation, and product trends.

---

### 🛠️ **What I Did**

1. **Data Exploration & Preparation (SQL):**

   * Retrieved schema metadata to understand all columns and data types.
   * Identified date ranges and customer age profiles to set the analysis window.

2. **Created Key Business Metrics (SQL Views):**

   * Total Sales: `$29.36M`
   * Orders Placed: `60.40K`
   * Quantity Sold: `60K`
   * Products Sold: `288`
   * Customers: `18.48K`
   * Segmented customers into **VIP**, **Gold**, and **New** based on loyalty and revenue contribution.

3. **Revenue & Distribution Analysis:**

   * Mapped revenue by **product category and subcategory**.
   * Analyzed **sales trends over time**, including cumulative revenue growth.
   * Explored **customer distribution** by country and gender.
   * Grouped products by price ranges (below 100, 100-500, etc.).

4. **Trend, Performance & Segmentation Modeling:**

   * Tracked yearly/monthly revenue trends with **window functions**.
   * Identified underperforming and outperforming products using **lag and average difference**.
   * Classified customers into behavior-based segments.

### 📊 **The Final Dashboard**

I built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to visualize:

* Sales KPIs and category-wise breakdown
* Customer distribution by geography and loyalty level
* Revenue contribution by product category
* Trend and cumulative analysis via a waterfall chart

---

### 🔍 **Insights Delivered**

* Most revenue comes from **Road Bikes** and **Mountain Bikes**.
* The **United States**, **Australia**, and **Canada** are the top-performing countries.
* **62%** of customers are **new**, indicating room to build long-term loyalty.
* The company has seen consistent growth between 2011–2014, peaking in 2014.

---

### 🙋‍♂️ **My Role**

I independently:

* Wrote optimized SQL queries and views to clean and shape the data
* Defined business logic (e.g., customer segmentation, performance bands)
* Designed a dashboard in Power BI that communicates clear and actionable insights

---

### 🏆 **Impact**

This project demonstrates my ability to:

* Translate raw data into real business value
* Combine **technical skills (SQL + BI tools)** with **business understanding**
* Build a data product that helps leadership **make informed decisions**
